Name index and nameserver
---

A nameserver is provided to which anyone can submit in cleartext and for everyone to see:
    - non-unique username
    - public key
    - personal ip; or group ip list
    - optional public status message.

The server offers unrestricted access.
Queriess from it are in the form `give me all names conforming to a regex`.
This should somewhat blind the server as to who does the asker want to message.
